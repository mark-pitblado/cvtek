cvtek is acronym for **CV** **TE**x **K**rafter.

Using cvtek, you can craft your [RÃ©sumÃ©/CV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) using a [TOML](https://toml.io) File. You feed the cvtek with a human readable/writable Resume TOML file and cvtek will generate ATS Friendly Latex Resume Source. You can then use Latex compiler (or [Latex to PDF](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action)) Or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to compile your resume to PDF.

Example `resume.toml` will look like this:

```toml
[header]
full_name = "John Doe"
email_addr = "john@doe.com"
github_username = "github"
linkedin_username = "linkedin"
location = "Some Place, Earth"
phone_number = "1234567890"

[[education]]
course_name = "Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science"
timeline = "August 2003 - July 2007"
university_name = "University at My Place"
university_link = "https://myopenuniversity.university"
location = "Another Place, Earth"
course_grade = "A"
points = ["Did some useful work Y", "Did some useful work Z"]

[[experience]]
comp_name = "Company ABC"
comp_link = "https://mygoodcompany.company"
exp_name = "Engineer"
timeline = "August 2008 - Present"
location = "Another place, Earth"
points = ["I joined this when i had mood to join", "I joined this to prove myself", "I achieved ABC here"]

[[projects]]
title = "My good project XYZ"
timeline = "January 2006 - Present"
project_link = "https://github.com/github"
description = "Some incredible project that I created"
points = ["I created this when i had mood to create", "I created this to prove myself"]

[skills]
Technologies = "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, whatever"
Frameworks = "ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL, whatever"

```
